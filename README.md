E-Commerce is a basic e-commerce website built using HTML, CSS, and little bit of JavaScript. It showcases a simple yet functional online shopping experience, including a product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout process. This project is a demonstration of front-end web development concepts.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For semantic structure.
CSS3: For styling, layout.
JavaScript : For interactivity and dynamic page updates.

Prerequisites
A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).

This project is a starting point for creating a fully functional e-commerce website. It is currently limited to front-end functionalities. Feel free to expand it as per your requirements.
